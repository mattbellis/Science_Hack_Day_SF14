Project to take 3D models of the universe (galaxies or dark matter concentrations)
and turn them into a file for 3D printing.


I am unfamiliar with some of the formats of these computer simulations, so maybe
it's easier than I think. Or harder? I'm not terribly familar with 3D printing, 
either. I do know that we eventually want a file in the STL format for the
3D printer.

I've mucked around with openscad a bit, which is a free program and allows you 
to build your 3D model with a fairly straighforward language of polygons, 
translations, and rotations. This program can dump output to STL trivially.

I've included a very simple openscad example file in this repo.

One idea I had was to write a program to take the universe simulations
and determine regions of density and represent them as spheres in openscad.
We'd then have to connect them together with the dark matter ``filaments" so 
the whole thing could be 3D printed. 

It's a pretty crude idea, so don't let this stop you coming up with a much 
better one!
