Project to create a website where users can enter in their location and see
how big the Large Hadron Collider is, by overlaying a circle of the same size
on a map. 

There are two starter files here:

* lhc_in_sf.html
  This is just a web page that makes use of Google Map's API to display 
  San Francisco and overlay two circles the size of the LHC (17 miles in
  circumference!).

* google_maps_api_hello_world.py
  A python script that shows how one could use Google Geocoding to get the latitude
  and longitude of a location from the city/state information.

Some of the particle physics accelerators that might be displayed are:

* Large Hadron Collider (CERN, Geneva, Switzerland)
  circular, radius = 4.3 km
  Collides protons and protons.
  Currently running.

* Tevatron (Fermilab, Batavia, IL)
  circular, radius = 1.0 km
  Collided protons and anti-protons. 
  1983-2011

* SLAC (SLAC, Stanford, CA) 
  linear, length = 3.2 km
  Accelerated electrons and anti-electrons, as well as just electrons for some experiments. 
  Particle physics (1966-2008), X-ray laser (2009-present)

* Very Large Hadron Collider/Future Circular Collider (proposed, CERN, Geneva, Switzerland).
  circular, radius = 12.7 km
  Would collide protons and protons.
  FUTURE!

* International Linear Collider (ILC) (proposed, Japan)
  linear, length = 80 km
  Would collide electrons and anti-electrons.
