Icecube is a particle physics experiment in Antarctica that looks for every high
energy neutrinos coming from outside our solar system. To do this, they melt holes 
in the ice and lower strings of very sensitive light detectors. When the neutrinos
hit the ice, they produce showers of other particles which themselves produce light
as they pass through the ice and it is this light that their detectros pick up. 

Icecube has instrumented about 1 cubic kilometer of ice!

They have released subsets of their data to the public and will be releasing even
more in the future. I've used some of their helper code to put together a 
simplified IPython notebook that lets you ``see" how their detectors light up
when a neutrino hits the ice.

I've included a small amount (10 neutrino collisions) in this Github repo, but
if you want more, just let me know!
