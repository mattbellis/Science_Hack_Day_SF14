Nima Arkani-Hamed is one of the leading physics theorists out there. The work 
that he and his colleagues are doing has the potential to upend our understanding 
of space and time and how we view reality 
( http://www.simonsfoundation.org/quanta/20130917-a-jewel-at-the-heart-of-quantum-physics/ ). 
I barely understand any of this. 
 
Nima is brilliant, but also a character in his own right. When he gives talks, he hand-writes 
all of his slides, rather than using PowerPoint/Keynote/Beamer, etc. This takes nothing 
away from the presentation, but if you've seen a few of his talks, you become very aware 
of his script-like handwriting. It's very artistic and evocative.

Here's some examples!

I'd be tickled pink, if we could construct a ``Nima" font. Maybe it's just a webpage 
that translates what you type into his handwriting style? Maybe more? Maybe a killer
art project? 

I don't know Nima personally, but I can't help but think he'd get a kick out of it, 
especially if it means that people are learning more about the work he and others are 
doing to understand the fabric of reality.

I'd be happy to send along to him whatever folks hack together!

While I don't have any ideas of how to do this, feel free to use this
repo to collect any of your great hacks!
