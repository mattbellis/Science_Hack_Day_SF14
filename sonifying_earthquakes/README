There are some great visualizations out there of earthquakes: where they happen, when they happen, how powerful they are. But in these static images, I feel we sometimes lose sight of what a dynamic environment the Earth is: creaking and groaning and stretching on a continuous basis. There are earthquakes happening *all the time*, but they might be small or in an unpopulated region (ocean) so we don't hear about them.
 
I found a great site that shows how to query the USGS website and build your own map of where/when earthquakes are occurring.

I'd love to play around with this to sonify (turn into sounds) these data. I'd like to ``hear" these earthquakes and get a sense of when they happen over the course of a year. I have some experience doing this with other projects within the processing language, so I think we could get a first-order hack going. But after that, there's probably a lot we could do with it!
