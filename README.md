Science_Hack_Day_SF14
=====================

Repo for fun hacks!

If you'd like to jump in, go ahead and fork this repo!

If you want to keep your work separate, just create your own directory
in whatever subdirectory (project) you're working, and I'll pull/merge
your stuff regularly. That way others can learn from what you're doing!

Some of the examples here use the following programs, so you might
want to install some of them before getting started (all free!).

* Python/IPython (notebook)/SciPy

The easiest way to install all of this, is probably with Anaconda.
