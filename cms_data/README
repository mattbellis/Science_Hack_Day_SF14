The CMS experiment is one of the two largest particle physics experiments at
the Large Hadron Collider and it's my primary research project!

We've released some of our data to the general public for research, 
education, outreach, or just having fun! And more is coming later this year!

I've worked on simplifying the data and the interface so that others can play with it. 
I've included a simple IPython notebook in this repo that gets you started ``seeing" the
data and learning how to interact with it.

Let me know what you might want to do this data. Art? Science? Education? Let's work
together on something cool!
